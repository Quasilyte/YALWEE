| Instruction   | Description                  |
|---------------+------------------------------|
| max_r0_r[1-7] | stores max of 2 regs into r0 |
| min_r0_r[1-7] | stores min of 2 regs into r1 |
|               |                              |
|               |                              |
|               |                              |

rule of thumbs:
- if operation consists of 4 or more basic operations,
it is not very useful because the user can assemble it with
prepareX;
- if operation consists of 2 operations, like decrev (sub + neg),
it is useful because it avoids additional overhead and saves
valuable executable memory;
- if some operations can be made with prepare but also
are wanted inside other prepared operations, it is a good
sign to intern that operation inside execution environment
to make that composition possible;
- control operations (like loops) and data operations (I/O included)
are candidates to internal ops

so, mostly new operations are needed to enchance "prepare" + "execute".
